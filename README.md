The aim of this project is implementing half precision 4 stage pipelined floating point adder according with the IEEE 754 standard. Verilog HDL is used for programming. The tool used for simulation is Synopsys VCS. The waveform is observed in EPwave.

Files included:
1. Simulation results of adder with and without pipeline(PNG  files) 
2. Project report(PDF file)
3. Compilation report(text files)
4. Design and TestBench files (Verilog and SystemVerilog files)
